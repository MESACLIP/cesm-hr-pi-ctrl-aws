# Tutorials

This set of CESM simulations have similar data structure and output variables as that of another CESM data product in the AWS Open Data program from NCAR, Community Earth System Model v2 Large Ensemble (CESM2 LENS) (https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-xilranwbl2ep2#overview). The tools and usage examples for CESM2 LENS (https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-xilranwbl2ep2#usage) should be usable for the current CESM-HR PI-CTRL dataset too, with a few necessary changes.

Once the AWS account for CESM-HR dataset has been approved and datasets are successfully transferred to AWS, it is possible to test a few Matlab based scripts using CESM-HR PI-CTRL data on the AWS and update the Tutorial related to this data product.
